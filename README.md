Hello, my name is Andrew Ingrassia.

I currently work as a Billing Analyst at Spectrum, where I specialize in managing and updating the company’s internal billing processes. My responsibilities include extracting, modifying, and re-importing data to ensure seamless integration. I also use SQL to validate that changes are accurately reflected and to ensure data integrity.

With a strong background in data management, I am looking to expand my expertise in data analysis and process optimization. I thrive in fast-paced environments, working under tight deadlines while collaborating with cross-functional teams to solve complex challenges and improve business processes.

I’m now focused on advancing my career by leveraging my experience to drive data-driven decision-making and enhance operational efficiency.
