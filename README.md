Hello, my name is Andrew Ingrassia, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. My path has been a winding one, taking me from a background in ministry and entrepreneurship to a newfound passion for data analysis. This transition, while unconventional, has ignited my enthusiasm for unraveling insights from complex datasets and making data-driven decisions. Join me as I explore this fascinating world of data and share my experiences, projects, and insights.

I began my career with a focus on ministry and aspirations of entering academia. However, a shift in my beliefs led me to a crossroads in my mid-20s. With limited career options, I entered the world of residential painting and built a successful business, driven by a commitment to delivering top-quality craftsmanship. However, I was eager for greater intellectual challenges. After deep self-reflection and exploration, I discovered my passion for computer science and Python programming. This fascination led me to the field of data analysis, where I uncovered my true calling. I took the initiative to enhance my skills through self-study, online courses, and ultimately, the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program.

I am poised to leverage my background, work ethic, and data analyst skills to uncover valuable insights. I am passionate about data's potential to drive informed decisions and am actively seeking a role where I can explore datasets with curiosity, collaborate with fellow analysts, and deliver high-quality analyses.
